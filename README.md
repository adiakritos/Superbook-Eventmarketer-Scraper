Superbook-Eventmarketer-Scraper
===============================

A scraper designed to pick up agency information from http://superbook.eventmarketer.com/category/agencies

The program picks up the information from that url, stores the data into a cvs file, and saves each related picture
into a folder with the agency name. 

I then imported the cvs into a client's Agency listing website. 

The next time I create a scraper I'll use an object oriented style to do it. This was written as a script, although it would be much more scalable and easier to maintain written with classes and functions. 

With this expeirence my next scraper was going to be designed to lift all the food information from myfitnesspal for a Ruby on Rails application I've been building.
